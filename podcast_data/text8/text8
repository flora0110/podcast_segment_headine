hello everybody I am back from the dead what's up welcome back to fingers crossed and I'm Christy I'm back because you know Chris is it a wonderful so last week I haven't text you about it because I wanted to have yours in your reaction to me before but I've gone to like tell you about things we like seeing for podcast so yes I am back in the day I die cuz yes Christie's last week the week before we take a break side covid-19 Jump Right In with that or if we have anything else you want to say before then so just backing it up you girl. Covid even though I've had all three shots and I unfortunately got really bad because most people I know who got the Omicron if there ever was like and a lot of people that is the reality but for other people including a lot of people who are fully vaccinated it is not the reality and I unfortunately got very sick I got like a full by high fever all the symptoms of a head cold a razor blade sore throat like tomorrow at felt like strep and muscle aches body aches back aches and I'm then I turn into this horrible cough where I was like struggling to breathe cuz I was coughing so bad end up going to the hospital if there's not supposed to happen when you and I gave me an inhaler I'm on two different antibiotics this whole thing is I am a house reasonably healthy person I am reasonably active could be more active this is actually been a big kicker to me that I want to be more in shape and more active not for any like aesthetic because I don't want for my lungs through something like this again and I'm hoping that if I can try to be a little more that I was my cardiovascular health that will help or at least the same time like you shouldn't blame your eye feel like with all those things you know it's you really just never know like you can see or you can expect that because you're X Y and Z that it's only going to hit you a certain way but like I think what we've learned that this entire pandemic relief just thought I'd expect the unexpected essentially like you really never know how it's going to play out or you know maybe someone who you thought would a hundred percent like be really susceptible to it wouldn't even have symptoms and then you don't know why it sucks so I am really grateful that it's not worse and I am grateful. actually really scary thought so yeah I'm I'm grateful to be doing better but I'm still at 100% it's been like two and a half weeks now at this point I actually know a half almost 3 weeks and I still have a cough they said that anyway since almost the beginning of the new year was literally covid-19 it's been really frustrating and I'll get him sis later you know just because it has really slowed down my job search you guys know when the last time we talked I was talking about you know that my main focus was applying to jobs and working on the wedding stuff and then we get super sick you kind of have to put all that on the back burner and focus on your house which I did talking a lot aggravates my cough so we have to keep this short if I get a coughing fit so you can just why I didn't want you to come on and try and talk like I don't think I could have done it like I was trying to be brave oh that was the other thing that happened what am I sending two coded as I got laryngitis and I completely lost my voice so I got her bottom torture free I just like couldn't talk at all and I was coughing and then I am I swallowed it feel like I'm swallowing literal fire it just I wouldn't wish it on anybody but the doctor said my cough can last up to a couple months while it's all clearing out of my system I can't live my life cuz I'm no longer contagious I don't have any more inspection out of my lungs like with the coughing it makes me feel so awful going in public cuz I can't explain it to every person I know like hey I'm recovering from pneumonia I'm going to be coughing for a couple months like we went to Cheesecake Factory last night and we are sitting in the bar and we could walk there and there was cold outside and cold air aggravates my cough so I had a few good coughs we stepped on the bar I'm still wearing my mask but like everybody turned and looked at me and I was just like oh my God I'm so embarrassed but I'm not just going to I just said yeah it is what it is myself into my voice a little raspy but I could also just be them morning or something to get a raspy voice because it's like kind of Sexy and I would like the what if you will call it but I I know you mean some people like makes more sense I feel like I kind of have like an annoying voice so having a little rest do it would make it worse unless you're like Ariana Grande she loves her own voice because it's subjective be great but you know what I mean like everyone's used to hearing their own voice especially when you get some sort of like makes it better because it's just difference when I'm editing the podcast and I like I'm listening back to the conversations we've had previously I get so annoyed with my voice in the most annoying little hag the shut up yourself that way I know it's Amber I'm on the mend thank you all for your well wishes and I didn't enjoy it at what point are you like oh this is so bad I need to go to the hospital was not like before you realize that you had a pneumonia yeah they only can really tell you have pneumonia if you I mean I had all the symptoms for sure but they did a chest x-ray at the hospital and that's how they found them infection if they did give me the inhaler which has helped when I get coughing fits but like they gave me two different types of antibiotics cuz they thought there may be a bacterial component but also if it's viral pneumonia you pretty much just have to wait it out and like get better which sucks but yeah I know I was after I had spent about 6 hours awake in the middle of the night not being able to sleep because I couldn't breathe without coughing I couldn't inhale I couldn't exhale there's some point where I was like I was like gasping for air like like because I was coughing so hard to where I was gasping and then I was getting dizzy from hyperventilating and I was like this I was like mrs. bad scary because like nobody wants to feel like they can't breathe so that was kind of my turning point cuz I really just wanted to get better at home I didn't want to have to go to a hospital full of Coke do people that is so overwhelmed that I mean the whole thing yourself so busy like half the people there had covid and they were beds lining the hallway with those people coughing left and right I have never had more respect for people working in the medical field than being in the hospital like getting a face to face pandemic movie it's always they were actors like it just it was it was beyond it was beyond awful but they took good care of me and I was there for about 10 hours is long long process and I was worried that they were going to make me stay overnight it really dependent on that my blood work and if my blood work came back normal or not which it did so while I had you know the X-ray was a little questionable like I didn't have any weird numbers in my blood cell counts are anything that would give them concerned that it's like the infection is more serious so they sent me home at like 10:30 p.m. also they didn't let Jason coming with me because of the covid-19 issue so I was in a hospital room alone and I was okay so enough about my illness. So that it's not I mean I agree with mucus man you know from their ad oh yeah it's kind of gross but there is a suit try to say that they do this to me were like I can't say this is not supposed to look into some Mucinex and how I can help your situation but if you're still with us and we're glad you're getting better from talking about my illness to talking about your episode Christy because I loved it I will see you and it was so vulnerable and you just floats Disney I was nervous at first that it wasn't going to flow that I was going to be awkward or not not having someone to like you said bounce back it was surprisingly easy just to talk and like it did feel like a diary or a therapy session so I felt like that for you too I was just so proud of you listening to it and like thinking back towards when we first started this podcast and like the kind of topics that we talked about and in that conversation that you mentioned if you guys listen to Christy so the last week which if you have not like we ran into some hurdles that were really hard for me to like bring up to Christy because I was like she was having a hard time opening up but I didn't want to like be that person that was pushing her boundaries no I didn't feel like the bad guy that was like trying to force you to talk about things you didn't want to talk talk about it that you didn't feel comfortable talking about but it was hard for me because I felt like there were walls are things that like we weren't able to get past it and it like wasn't up to me to make you get past them right that's why it's a challenge when it's like a two-person project where you both did I say that Blake a group project where you're both getting graded but like one person isn't pulling their weight but you know when we started the process everything like it's a completely voluntary thing like we just do this for you know there's no one I wish I would use it it's it's mostly like just a passion project for us right so it was like for me it was hard to you know motivate myself in a way or like I just didn't see the need to like why should I push the boundary like I do my project that I can set the terms of but at the same time like it's holding you back in the fence it like of what we wanted it to be you know you can't just like skirt around surface one person is you know going for the challenges that we ran into and I sure like would be interesting to hear from your perspective to at that time cuz I feel like you approach it really nicely and I think you had a harder time with it that I did because you don't like confrontation and I was going to hurt your feelings and I know I was it's really difficult it's like when your roommates your best friend and you got to have that sit down with him and tell him like you know you are not pulling your chores or whatever you're not doing this and but it's really hard when your best friend is your business partner cuz in this like we are friends but we're also business partners in a way it's like how do I bring up a conversation as a business partner without hurting my best friend and that was a bridge that was super super hard for me because it our business is a personal thing too because it is exhausting someone to talk about personal things that they're not obligated to but in the way that you know I think it's our main problem too is that we had set out to make this like a super open you know real conversations and then I still like even though I intended that wasn't in the place to get there and I didn't really realize that I think at the time or maybe I did but I was kind of like in denial about what it would take you know I was like what this feel like a real looking to blah blah blah and then when it actually came to getting there I was like I was oblivious to it and I fell just as frustrated in a way but I didn't really have the perspective or tools to really stay like you know I didn't get why I thought it was hard for me either like I didn't get why I couldn't like talk about things are like it just yeah I think I was just in a place where I still had work to do that I didn't know how to approach you know approached me with it was really like thoughtful and caring and not like an accusatory place it's not like six times before bringing it up to you so it's fine I know but then when you told me that like it made me even more uncomfortable I don't know I don't like when people and not sorry I did that made me sound like I was hanging out like when you do this but it makes me uncomfortable when people feel that they have to like confront me with something you know where like they feel like they have to practice this speech to me and I'm like I don't want to put people in that place where they're anxious about like approaching me with something like I wanted to be easy from the start or Let Me ease your worries I would do that with anybody that I care about I care so much about your feelings in cuz I knew this was so personal to you that like I would do the same as I was confronting my mom about something I would practice it or go over in my head person because you guys struggle with that is really hard for me I think it comes from like you talked about in your episode with the whole rejection thing like I get so afraid that if I bring up my concerns they're going to leave me because I would like the abandonment want to deal with what I have to say so it's easier to not say anything that's why I put so much effort into gingerly probably more than more than somebody who's a little more secure in that would be sidetracked but I heard it's relevant to and I think that also kind of that was probably even that was definitely before we did our confrontation episode but I think it kind of just like it was treated us like we've learned so much about our friendship and our Dynamic from this podcast like we talked about it with the whole like approaching a Business Partnership kind of angle and balancing our own bike personalities and personal boundaries and realized how different we were on confrontation and I feel like we made the confrontation episode did we make it after that or was it before or was it when I was having to deal with the the the mysterious business that was really loud outside my door and told me that it was a combination of things but I do remember like I don't know because again I think all of us that just goes to show that we all you know kind of project our insecurities on what someone else is doing what it's not you shouldn't take it personally you know like I took it personally that you felt like you had a good day just thinking about you in front of me and I was like oh my God I did something wrong like I feel bad about that but really it was your insecurity of a challenge to and it's like completely ones coming from their own place you know and it isn't my head I created this whole narrative that you were going to be like will see her doesn't accept me for who I am and so I'm going to quit the podcast if she can accept me at where I'm at and she can do this by herself and in fact I don't need her as a friend either by then like I made this in my head because we all have our worst-case scenario that we run through of course that's my biggest fear is that I bring up your concern of mine and somebody says it's not worth it and they leave like that's in that comes from again like you talked about that in your episode the what is it like corned beef versus Court commitments you know I was trying to think about that like you know if you strive for this or you want this it means that you need this or whatever the light comes your conversion chart was I was I was listening. I was kind of thinking back to like some of my own entertainment lawyers in trying to figure out what is like the actual like the root root of the knee right as I was in very interesting for me to about that but yeah just circling back like I I just feel like on this podcast we've been doing this for a year-and-a-half now to get started in July of 2020 and a half of a big blowout bash for our 2-year anniversary so I just think we've come so far and I'm as I was listening to it I was also thinking that sometimes I get wrapped up in like oh this episode didn't get as many views as I wanted her we lost 10 followers on the Instagram account or like things like that don't matter I was listening to your episode and I really just kind of made me think like this podcast I'm not saying it's all about us because we do this also because we love our community we created in like reaching out to you guys and when you guys reach out to us and say that something's made an impact on you it means the world to us but at the same time like I have grown so much as a person from having this podcast and I think you have to and what is almost a diary of our growth of the last year-and-a-half like if I was to go back and spend God knows how many hours and listen to every episode it would be like watching a child grow up because I listen to our Dynamic you know or even if I just listened to a Clipper like what we were talking about or even the subject of our episodes I just feel like I am grown so much and then listen to your episode you have grown so much as someone who sees you from an outside perspective and I just I honestly just felt proud as hell if we're doing our best and putting like putting our effort in our love into this like that's that's all that matters and like I just felt very free of as some of the other things that I worry about sometimes as far as like number zero mean it's like it's not even if just talking about us in our podcast but I think it's important to remember and sometimes it takes it takes those like a light bulb 9003 really see the Milestones are how far you've got what something to realize that like maybe the outcome isn't what you predicted but you can't predict what's actually going to make you happy like we talked about about if you can't predict was actually going to fill you and you look back and realize that you've made so much progress in a completely different way that you didn't know you actually needed more external pot for thinking that it would lead to this career opportunity or whatever it is like sometimes you just needed the internal growth more and you know I think that's the beauty of life is that it's not a when your past and that it always comes back to like maybe you look back and realize why you needed something more than you can look for it see why you will need something I think and I think I'm watching for us for sure proud of us for those who can't see this which is everyone she just did one of those like the peace sign things so thank you for that right I just had to wrap up anyway thank you for listening I recorded it in Final Cut Pro to edit it and I just talked to the first like 15 minutes I can even pause it and then like inside of the ad and then I stumbled like twice and I would just pause it cut it out and keep the boarding and then by the time I was done recording that's awesome where I was yeah I think about the time you spent saved on that that's that's that's amazing a labor of love that adding that we definitely need to start looking into some better editing software programs because it's a long time anyway I digress but yes it was great Christie and I really I was just I was so I felt like I don't want to sound patronizing	 but I felt like a proud mom listening to it like I I really did but I think it's because like you especially are in a certain position like as my best friend who's been there through a lot with me throughout you know the last seven years from the podcast like I know right through college and your time where I just need the very surface of what you were going through with her self-confidence in college look again cuz you never talked about it but I need like just a very surface of my own observations plus your fitness journey what works with that and what did it you know and then all of your moves all of your jobs like I guess I just as you know with me like you know how much I've changed and grown since you know college in the choices that I've made that inverse of the choice they make now so it looking back to it's like easy to have more compassion for those passwords and save yourselves especially when you kind of understand it if you haven't listened or read the mountain is You by Brianna Wiest I literally mean every person but the core commencing core needs like it just explains so much about other people in your life but also other versions of yourself you know like choices for a reason and now you cringe. But at that time you were trying to fill this corny or no I guess that you'd be trying to fill the core commitment with the wrong need you know what I mean or is that too early I think we all miss understand our own and other people's like what they're committed to you sometime so understanding. And sometimes you just won't be able to because it's something that's like deeply rooted in them that they haven't healed from or something like that but just like having that sort of Grace for people explains a lot and like gives you a little bit of you no compassion for them in that moment because it's easy to judge him his choices from the outside but you really don't know what they're trying to get at on the inside why are you smart I'm so sorry for smiling does this compassion extend to that time when I bailed on you in the bar with a friend was like no you're not allowed to stay at home with a guy instead and I was trying to fill a corn need of wanting to be loved by Jackie said it's an excuse but take us to the funniest I wish to God I still had a voicemail from Christy so do you delete it or did you get a new phone or not and it's disappeared is on the old phone anyway I wish I had it a week at a store right here it's literally because I'm laughing laughing is Christy like I am so mad at you I don't know where you are or what you're doing and it causes me to use a fake name is not out of it I'll say she'll be like she's like in the bag Savannah in the bag cuz my friend is actively throwing up and then she goes back to me like I don't know where you are but you have left here with Savannah and the bird you took them into the back of a New Year's sabbatical so funny and I don't think I would definitely still because I left Christian at the bar this is the best part is that I was at the bar with Savannah she was not doing well she got kicked out and I didn't have a key to the house so that I can get back in the bar because they kicked us out and so I was like calling everyone I think it was I don't know where are the remotes work but I was calling you you weren't answering I was like what is going on I knew you were in that bar with us and you were texting me you're like oh sorry I would matter or something and I was like okay can you give me your key like you need to come with me like she is not doing well she's barely upright and then you're like you come out you hand me your key and then you run back to your and I was like are you kidding me he would we don't leave you with his girl yeah I don't think he's ever been is angry at me is that nice Christian ever there's another time when you raise your voice at me like I do really getting upset again it's only finding out voicemail remember listening to it the next morning or did I do because I just wanted to be loved by a terrible fraternity I thought would feel Mike or commitments and no he never will so you live you learn as you grow from it in that way but anyway. so yes personal growth proud of each other major strides all those good things anyways I guess you're still in check in with the job search you know what today this is a good sign it is the official end of Mercury retrograde for the past 3 weakness so we all have a free pass to blame our problems and health today is the day that you're officially turning over a new leaf and good luck is coming for you and all of the shity things that I feel so bad you guys Sierra has been having a never-ending string of bad luck with the sickness like so many little things to you like she'll text you tell him I'm just going to give this small example if this is like the straw that broke the camel's back like this camel no longer has any bones I talk to vacuum out an example of she would text us needs over like all these things like oh no like I'm dealing with this and now we're taking the cat to the hospital and blah blah blah and she's like she's like but it's okay because I'm going to go to treat myself to a Starbucks or like yeah Sierra like getting coffee like feel better she goes to Starbucks she's like it's closed and there like all Barbara like hopefully there's another one she goes to and she's like what what happened at 1 p.m. on a Sunday in like I understand that the Labour shortage I was still having like the worst day of my life like it's just it was all part of the things for the little things kept piling on so I was telling her that I clearly this was a scientific proof that she had lost her good luck somewhere and she had to kiss a mysterious stranger no offense to Jason I like this the luck is more important and she didn't understand the reference because she'd never seen just my luck and so I made me watch I've never seen Christy so adamant that I need to do something when she was I was having a little on the worst day it was one of those days that was so bad this is about 3 days ago that I was driving around in my car without a destination just crying like just driving around just crying nowhere to go turning left turning right don't care where I'm going like it was just Rock Bottom I think there was probably somebody on either side of me a red light who is just like looked over to like this girl is having a very bad day because Austin has I talk to myself when I cried just like rant about everything so I'm like crying and Sunday night so Christy was like you've got to watch just my luck tonight it will make your life better it will fix you you will feel so good like a rom-com is all you need explained your luck situation like all this stuff is like this I make you understand why all these bad things have been happening to you you got to watch this 2000 she's in bed mode me $5 and was like use this to rent on Amazon Prime you have no excuse and it was not your to pay for it so it's like you know what Siri I need a vent motor and get ahead of most every rental on Amazon Prime is that a 299 or 399 it was 99 Cents because it's not a premium movie I should watch it then what a dlu only a dollar so I got kept $4 for my next Starbucks run that's going to be closed because Mark is out of retrograde so it's anyway so I watch the movie it was very cute but I have since yesterday I have been feeling like my luck is turning around it has been I don't know if you say Mercury in retrograde today yesterday I just got a notification today so maybe it was up it was a pre-register bad luck would like to find everything of my life but I'd say at least 98% efficient date that ended and there's literally an article that's like seven Mercury retrograde must-haves to get you through these final off-kilter days or selling random products too like what does new $78 dehumidifier online air out of your lungs okay start us had a job interview yesterday and I have another one next week I have a different job different jobs so I had one yesterday for next week and then I applied to a job two nights ago that I'm so stoked about then I really worked hard on the application for like 4 hours on it so hopefully they give me a few I feel like things are starting to move the needle a little bit I'm feeling better and you know we rescheduled a few plans that we had to cancel through my illness so it it just slowly feels like the luck is turning around to bit yes glad that you are on the up because you guys like we see her wasn't recording the podcast and he's past couple weeks obviously but like this is a happiest like most chipper I've seen you in awhile and it makes me so happy because I know that you deserve to have a good luck streak so we are going to lean into it and we going to keep the momentum going and it's only going up from here so I think just watching just my luck I think that was the Catalyst that turned my luck around right they don't know I'm a stranger but just watching someone else do it their luck was probably all you needed to feel so much better and maybe you have maybe they definitely have the right now just my luck black makes me cough but watching in the beginning of the movie I don't want to give away too much one of the characters has the best luck in the world the other character is literally have everything going wrong today and in the opening scene you're seeing the parallel the to the character everything is going wrong I was watching it with Jason I was like this this has been my last 3 weeks like everything is going wrong for this person to the point where it's like their pants and then they drop their sandwich and then I step in dog poop and then they trip and fall of the Subway and then this happened and then they get a call from their boss they're fired and I was like this is literally been my life that's why I wanted you to know it was very fala dating so I have you seen this movie with this is my guest 7% organs yes I'm no gas and no 55 55 I mean when you entered the mainstream media cuz I did grow up and kind of lack of movies cuz you were still in the middle high school anyway but now you seen it and I understand I just thought it might be better if you just turned around and you know everything is temporary and it made me feel better just to watch the movie that you told me to watch and because you cared enough to think it would make me feel better so that I felt your love through the screen everyone if you're listening to this now and you haven't seen just my luck go watch it and then that's the theme of this episode this week do you have any life of days to share Christie I know you said your last episode you were getting more responsibilities at work and that was really excited cuz I've been going really well and then suddenly I'm like oh I'm supposed to have this pulled together by then and reaching out to this person and it's just a lot but I feel like it's new for me because I'm like organizing an event and I've definitely been a part of that in the past but I've never been like in charge or been like the main point person so it's kind of stressful but in a good way like I think it's it's a good challenge and I am learning from it and we saw some time cuz it's next month but it's just coordinating with a lot of people that I don't know translations in a bunch of stuff but other than that is good it's been like very I've been gone into the office or anything because of the covid-19 hopefully things will be back in person relatively soon I would help because of covid cases in New York like went down down really fast like I think now they're back to like a thousand pieces a day and in the height of the Omicron surge was like 50 	000 new cases a day and I think that before it was probably around like it's kind of using back hopefully I don't want to jinx anything but I think we're going to see you sing the end of The Surge and part of what I was really excited about before the search happened was that they had announced that we be able to actually go back into the UN in person in January and so I was like really stoked about that and then obviously they revise thing is when covid was presenting itself to be a challenge once again so things in person coming up and I don't know I think everyone's feeling like everyone was already feeling the virtual have to come here and do some of that I'm just I'm feeling optimistic that maybe next month things will be in a better position to like maybe have some more news experiences that are in person rather than just like the continuously virtual things and events all that so I don't know what else life is good enjoying the winter in New York cold-ass weather ice and snow front storm thing it's really fun actually because then we went into Central Park when I was like covered in snow was a really cute time to be in Central Park and then the snow has melted there still some on the sidewalks and now it's like rain so and now it's going to be in the New York weather spear but it's definitely still a lot of sunny days still try to make the most of it in one of the warm days of passing I went ice skating in Central Park in there like ice skating rink in the corner where it's all the buildings are in the background and it was so much fun and it was just one of those picture a picture a spanking or call a few weeks ago like spur of the moment but it wasn't one of the classic New York rinks you know it wasn't like ice-skating at Rockefeller Center and Central Park or Brian Eno's comes exactly exact.
