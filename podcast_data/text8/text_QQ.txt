hello everybody I am back from the dead what's up welcome back to fingers crossed and I'm Christy I'm back because you know Chris is it a wonderful so last week I haven't text you about it because I wanted to have yours in your reaction to me before but I've gone to like tell you about things we like seeing for podcast so yes I am back in the day I die cuz yes Christie's last week the week before we take a break side covid-19 Jump Right In with that or if we have anything else you want to say before then so just backing it up you girl. Covid even though I've had all three shots and I unfortunately got really bad because most people I know who got the Omicron if there ever was like and a lot of people that is the reality but for other people including a lot of people who are fully vaccinated it is not the reality and I unfortunately got very sick I got like a full by high fever all the symptoms of a head cold a razor blade sore throat like tomorrow at felt like strep and muscle aches body aches back aches and I'm then I turn into this horrible cough where I was like struggling to breathe cuz I was coughing so bad end up going to the hospital if there's not supposed to happen when you and I gave me an inhaler I'm on two different antibiotics this whole thing is I am a house reasonably healthy person I am reasonably active could be more active this is actually been a big kicker to me that I want to be more in shape and more active not for any like aesthetic because I don't want for my lungs through something like this again and I'm hoping that if I can try to be a little more that I was my cardiovascular health that will help or at least the same time like you shouldn't blame your eye feel like with all those things you know it's you really just never know like you can see or you can expect that because you're X Y and Z that it's only going to hit you a certain way but like I think what we've learned that this entire pandemic relief just thought I'd expect the unexpected essentially like you really never know how it's going to play out or you know maybe someone who you thought would a hundred percent like be really susceptible to it wouldn't even have symptoms and then you don't know why it sucks so I am really grateful that it's not worse and I am grateful. actually really scary thought so yeah I'm I'm grateful to be doing better but I'm still at 100% it's been like two and a half weeks now at this point I actually know a half almost 3 weeks and I still have a cough they said that anyway since almost the beginning of the new year was literally covid-19 it's been really frustrating and I'll get him sis later you know just because it has really slowed down my job search you guys know when the last time we talked I was talking about you know that my main focus was applying to jobs and working on the wedding stuff and then we get super sick you kind of have to put all that on the back burner and focus on your house which I did talking a lot aggravates my cough so we have to keep this short if I get a coughing fit so you can just why I didn't want you to come on and try and talk like I don't think I could have done it like I was trying to be brave oh that was the other thing that happened what am I sending two coded as I got laryngitis and I completely lost my voice so I got her bottom torture free I just like couldn't talk at all and I was coughing and then I am I swallowed it feel like I'm swallowing literal fire it just I wouldn't wish it on anybody but the doctor said my cough can last up to a couple months while it's all clearing out of my system I can't live my life cuz I'm no longer contagious I don't have any more inspection out of my lungs like with the coughing it makes me feel so awful going in public cuz I can't explain it to every person I know like hey I'm recovering from pneumonia I'm going to be coughing for a couple months like we went to Cheesecake Factory last night and we are sitting in the bar and we could walk there and there was cold outside and cold air aggravates my cough so I had a few good coughs we stepped on the bar I'm still wearing my mask but like everybody turned and looked at me and I was just like oh my God I'm so embarrassed but I'm not just going to I just said yeah it is what it is myself into my voice a little raspy but I could also just be them morning or something to get a raspy voice because it's like kind of Sexy and I would like the what if you will call it but I I know you mean some people like makes more sense I feel like I kind of have like an annoying voice so having a little rest do it would make it worse unless you're like Ariana Grande she loves her own voice because it's subjective be great but you know what I mean like everyone's used to hearing their own voice especially when you get some sort of like makes it better because it's just difference when I'm editing the podcast and I like I'm listening back to the conversations we've had previously I get so annoyed with my voice in the most annoying little hag the shut up yourself that way I know it's Amber I'm on the mend thank you all for your well wishes and I didn't enjoy it at what point are you like oh this is so bad I need to go to the hospital was not like before you realize that you had a pneumonia yeah they only can really tell you have pneumonia if you I mean I had all the symptoms for sure but they did a chest x-ray at the hospital and that's how they found them infection if they did give me the inhaler which has helped when I get coughing fits but like they gave me two different types of antibiotics cuz they thought there may be a bacterial component but also if it's viral pneumonia you pretty much just have to wait it out and like get better which sucks but yeah I know I was after I had spent about 6 hours awake in the middle of the night not being able to sleep because I couldn't breathe without coughing I couldn't inhale I couldn't exhale there's some point where I was like I was like gasping for air like like because I was coughing so hard to where I was gasping and then I was getting dizzy from hyperventilating and I was like this I was like mrs. bad scary because like nobody wants to feel like they can't breathe so that was kind of my turning point cuz I really just wanted to get better at home I didn't want to have to go to a hospital full of Coke do people that is so overwhelmed that I mean the whole thing yourself so busy like half the people there had covid and they were beds lining the hallway with those people coughing left and right I have never had more respect for people working in the medical field than being in the hospital like getting a face to face pandemic movie it's always they were actors like it just it was it was beyond it was beyond awful but they took good care of me and I was there for about 10 hours is long long process and I was worried that they were going to make me stay overnight it really dependent on that my blood work and if my blood work came back normal or not which it did so while I had you know the X-ray was a little questionable like I didn't have any weird numbers in my blood cell
