In fact, that one of my favorite subjects to cover on this channel. That's just something about a movie failing. It's intended message through its own incompetence extra layer of 5 nuts, on top of an already fully start stirred. And if the message itself is bad, then all the more reason not to hold back. Turn off for though. He's kind of different. It tells the story of a gay couple who want to get married and the frigidus, they suffer as a result. It's messages about the Injustice of, not allowing same-sex marriage and the consequences of homophobia. Here's the thing. I don't disagree with that message. Homophobia is pretty stupid statements. Only on this channel. Yes. I'd like to report that I am both stunning and brave and as the old joke goes, if gay people want to be as miserable as the rest of us. Then more power to him. On this movie was made back in 2003. When same-sex marriage, wasn't legal anywhere in the US during my supposedly green and pleasant land. \", \"So there's nothing wrong with this movie in principle.

You could think of it as the room of gay movies, but it's actually closer to Potomac Ave. Its production quality. And in the sense that it tried to have a positive political message, but was so spectacularly incompetent, but whatever. Message it tried to convey was drowned out by all the rock has lost her, do it. Hugh. At least the room had good production values on some decent talk thing, but been an author is worse than the room in every conceivable way you even and how it shoe horns in a pointless reveal of the direct cause bad ass, which I sense it, because come on, you can join my pay for real know if if you really want to see that.

Self-involved filmmaking is Tommy Wiseau, and then turned it up to 11. He is credited for that with me on this director producer or executive producer, lead, actor, screenplay script supervisor.

I do feel a bit bad for him because he himself admitted you called do the best job you can, while you're trying to do everything at once, when she was. Do you?

Seriously, fuck off, but Arthur has my other phone isn't willing to display. Their relationship in public know that we haven't got to witness this. They make And we talked back to the gold Squad. Well, holy water recipe that you can shift paprika. So, Victor awkwardly, attaches it to office door and then I don't know what exactly was the plan ahead when she expecting him to just drink it, but it also go on their honeymoon, which just angers victim or so, he goes to see his local Catholic priests who says, he has to kick me out with the church, because he's the brother of a game on. They're afraid that you may hold some sort of carnal deep-seated evil energy. And quite frankly. I'm going to have to ask you to stop offering your services to the church, which is definitely not how the Catholic Church works. \", \"Really doesn't Justice. And I have to say that the priest was by far the most appropriate costing. He definitely looks like someone who likes to lose himself for the tears of altar Boyz. This expulsion only makes me even more enraged at his brother, Jamie, Oliver mediates for him. And then fix it goes back to see the priest. Victor thinks that killing author will free him from the demons that I'm making him Gay and thus save his soul, which is definitely not how Christianity works. So the deal is killed when an author and fix. It can come back to the church. I know. Tony is the priest totally fine with this key. \", \"Even referred him to a hit man. I swear I'm not making any of this up. Victor Troy's one more time to get alter to repent. For the he told me that you're running a cornershop, what you are. When do we see that happen? Now you say this, what's on Bluebonnet, and shove it up your ass. Let's be honest. One of them already has. So off the kicks him out and then vacuums up. Something that goes out to get more food than to bring the radiant imitating, hit mine to their apartments, and they shoot fun, and leave him for dead. Knowing that his brother is responsible, all the snakes into Victor's Apartments, sick, moves by the way, everything and they have another confrontation that meant to be dramatic, but can't help but be hilarious. Your ass to go to detective earlier that he gets let go and the cops never show up. Again off of listens in as Victor cools. The priest then goes directly to the church was the priest into giving him the hit man's name and address. Not that he ever does anything without information, knocks him out with nail polish remover, Sasha is back to his car to get some gasoline and then the priests unlife, this film is going. Directions off of them retrieves, been from the hospital. The fact that the American health-care system would let him go home and not buy. The condition is the most realistic thing about the movie, Victor shows up to their apartment again, and again, they don't check who it is before opening the door at this point. It's just Darwinism in action. Anacostia goes to Victor, chloroform's author, but doesn't restrain him for some reason, then stripped him naked and forcibly. Baptized him in the bathtub. I'm pretty sure this is somebody's Kink. Victor chloroform's him again. Again leaves him unrestrained also did no one else in the apartment block. React to the gunshots or do they say about what a naughty boy? He's being an author G. Begun been took from his wife earlier. That's what she wants. You want to fuck me, don't you factor? This is a reference to that famous scene from Scarface book, way more questionable. Genuinely spy on me again. This is nothing short of amazing. And that's how it is with several bangs on a whimper. Been. An author is about as big a fighter as you can get. While I actually remembering to turn the camera on on yet. I kind of liked it. It was motivated out of, I'm a genuine injustice. How much the product of sincere Passion by someone who both wanted to make a name for himself, on make a difference in some way marevich, spent years of his life and a lot of his own money to make this happen and he did and I can't help but respect that, more than the steel soulless corporate trash. We get on the daily at least and he seems to have taken the criticism in his destroyed. Admitting that the movie has its faults and that he was out of his depth when making it and he seems to have kept his head high. \", \"So good for him on frankly. I was having way too much fun with been an offer to have anything, but positive feelings towards it. This one is firmly within the so bad. It's good category. If you can, especially with a group of friends and a load of alcohol and Lube, you won't regret it. I don't know. I don't have to say this to you guys. All right, good here. Except Maps. They can do one. Pretty. Poor choice of words. I just remember, folks. It's not gay. If it's in a threeway. That's great. It's your penis. So seeing how the twitch metagame is working right now, but maybe I should do a video of me, licking my microphone. So that's what I'm going to end this video on. Okay, what do I what do I even start my start? Do you still have the base or do you start the test? All right. So it is not enough to start an onlyfans with.
