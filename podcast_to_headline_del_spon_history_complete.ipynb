', \"We're going to be talking about the Rosewood Massacre. \", 'How do you heard of it? ', 'Yeah, exactly. ', 'Exactly. ', 'I completely blew my mind is like, why in the Waldo did we not learn about this in school? ', 'Correction? ', 'I can only speak for myself here. ', 'So why in the hell did my history books? ', 'Not teach this Rosewood Massacre? ', 'Yeah. ', 'It happened. ', \"Let's discuss and learn together. \", 'What took place in 1923, Rosewood, Florida, buckle, and kitty cats. ', 'This is just what? ', \"Yeah, I'm great with words. \", 'Obviously. ', \"That's why I started to podcast the beginning. \", 'Great place to start the town of Rosewood was established in the mid-1800s. ', 'White families had moved here prior to the Civil War and black landowner started to move in in the 1870s. ', \"It's located in the State of Florida and it's just nine miles east of the Gulf of Mexico. \", 'The name Rosewood. ', 'It came from the red cedar trees that were all over the land. ', 'Their fun fact, alert. ', 'Did you know that when you cut open a red cedar tree, the cedar has a pale pink color inside? ', \"Yeah, I guess it's like super pretty, super beautiful. \", 'But did you also know that you cut me open? ', \"I've got a little pink inside and anyways, so they called the town Rosewood after the pink color. \", 'Be nice. ', 'Right? ', \"Well as we've learned through history, we can't have nice things. \", 'When people saw the really pretty color that was inside of these beautiful incredible trees. ', 'What do you think they did? ', \"They cut them down and they sold the lumber now because of this they made a pretty decent amount of money and it's supported the economy of the town but still, you know, God for the trees by the year 1886 the town had developed quite a bit. \", 'It had its own post office, a Schoolhouse and there were three churches one for the white people into for the black people. ', \"Remember, we're talking about a time. \", \"That's very A segregated America. \", 'So four years later in 1890 the town began to hit some hard times. ', 'All the red cedar trees have been chopped down and without the trees. ', \"There's no money to be made which in turn leads to the town's economic decline because of the loss of income and not many available jobs, many members of the white Community left, Rosewood, and headed to the nearby town of Sumner Sumner was appealing because there was a large Sawmill which provided tons of jobs and right now the people needed work, so, sign me up for something, you know, so by the year 1903, what population has now shifted to a majority black community? \", \"Now, it's a Rosewood. \", 'There was a really close sense of community. ', 'Like, everyone seemed to know one another and looked out for one another as well. ', 'I mean, rarely did anyone need to leave town like to travel for food or for things? ', 'They may need because they had almost everything right there. ', 'Andros, what in addition to the three churches Schoolhouse and post office, Rosewood also had a train station, which will become important later a general store and a Sugar Mill. ', 'Plus, if you were looking for some fun, they even had a Rosewood baseball team. ', \"What I'm getting at is Rosewood, was overall, just a nice place. \", 'So, for over 20 years, the people of Rosewood stayed with in Rosewood and the people of Sumner the neighboring town, they stayed with in Sumner, they coexisted.

', \"That's probably what they did. \", 'Anyways, so James leaves his wife and a home alone cuz he has to go to work. ', 'She works at The Sawmill in Sumner which was about 1 mi east of Rosewood. ', 'LOL. ', 'James at work. ', 'Milling, saws Fanny back at home. ', 'Rumor had it. ', 'Someone had attacked her. ', 'Oh, yeah. ', 'Oh, yeah, the neighbors heard screams. ', \"We heard screams coming from within the Taylor's house and they were like, oh my God, you know, like what's going on screaming? \", \"So for you and I, we probably go and, like check it out, right would be like, oh my God, you're screaming. \", 'Are you? ', \"Okay, but for Fanny's, Neighbors. \", 'I heard the screams and then they just left it alone. ', 'Great Tina. ', 'So sometime those by and James comes home from work and when he gets home, he sees that fanny has a big bruise on her face. ', \"It's clear that somebody had hit her pretty badly. \", 'So he asked her, you know, who did this to you and Fanny tells him that a black man assaulted her. ', \"She's like, I don't know who it was, but it was definitely a black man. \", 'According to Fanny. ', 'I mean, this could be possible. ', 'This guy came in randomly, beat her, I guess in her own house, but remember like this is a small town. ', 'In fact.

', \"That's where you sell Fanny, Fanny? \", 'They could not name the person who attacked her. ', 'That should have been the first red flag. ', 'Okay. ', 'That maybe this person that attacked her was not a resident from Rosewood.

', \"Like we are so angry and nobody wanted to like double check and make sure where she what he wasn't lying. \", \"They just said, okay, and the story about Saint Nick, it's back to a woman by the name of Sarah carrier. \", \"She's like, wait a minute. \", 'Wait a minute. ', ' ', ' ', \"That's not true. \", \"Singer said that she was at the Tailor's home, the morning of that so-called attack and not just that, but her granddaughter was there with neither of them. \", 'Saw black man attacks.

', 'Now, this County Sheriff, was able to get a bunch of other white men together to form. ', 'What was called a posse to help with the search. ', \"Now, this isn't like your normal Posse today, like a group of friends hanging out back. \", 'Then a posse was a more formal thing.

            "[\"Hi friends. Happy Wednesday or Thursday if you're watching over on YouTube. Hey, how are you doing? I hope you're having a wonderful day so far. My name is Bailey. Sarian. And this is the dark History podcast on your team song for dark history. Don't I anywho, I'm here to talk about some dark ass history that we never learned in school or I should, at least say that I never learned in school if you're new here. Hi, welcome, take a seat by me. Don't be shy. If you're interested in learning about people and events that your history books in a covering school and maybe should have then you'll fit in right in here with us. Ok luck today, story. It's uncomfortable. Okay, it's heartbreaking. It's it's just, it's it's awful. It's that there's, those are all the words I can think of it, just doesn't make any sense. But with all of that being said, there's really like, no sugar-coating this, this is what happened and it's when were honest and when were transparent that we can learn and grow together, you know,But most of all not let history repeat itself. So let's set the scene. It's New Year's Day, 1923 and many people are waking up from celebrating the New Year. Some of them are still wearing a flapper dress or suit tired from dancing. The night away in a jazz club, or maybe they're hung over from buying illegal drinks at a speakeasy. Yes. Oh, yes. It was still illegal to buy alcohol wild, right? Of course, though. That was more like the upscale say Vibe. If you were in the country had little less pocket change to spend or we're to straightedge to visit, like those kind of the legal joints. Then you probably had a quiet evening of staying at home and bringing in the new year, with with your loved ones. You know, Warren G. Harding would die in office. The Yankee Stadium would be built in the Bronx and the original Hollywood sign would be built. Oh, yeah, Hollywood was originally called hollywoodland, but we could say that for another episode, babe. \", 'For all of that, on the morning of January 1st, 1923 30 year old James, and his 22-year old wife, Fannie, Taylor woke up at a home, and a town called Sumner, a neighboring community of Rosewood. Florida, that morning. James Taylor goes to work like he did any other day. But while James was at work, something happens to his wife Annie that boy, it just triggers a domino effect, a horrific domino effect. It leads to the murders of innocent people. The destruction of a town and the displacement of an entire Community changing Rosewood forever. ', \"I know because it is. Welcome. Hi, this episode friends. We're going to be talking about the Rosewood Massacre. How do you heard of it? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I completely blew my mind is like, why in the Waldo did we not learn about this in school? Correction? I can only speak for myself here. So why in the hell did my history books? Not teach this Rosewood Massacre? Yeah. It happened. Let's discuss and learn together. What took place in 1923, Rosewood, Florida, buckle, and kitty cats. This is just what? Yeah, I'm great with words. Obviously. That's why I started to podcast the beginning. Great place to start the town of Rosewood was established in the mid-1800s. White families had moved here prior to the Civil War and black landowner started to move in in the 1870s. It's located in the State of Florida and it's just nine miles east of the Gulf of Mexico. The name Rosewood. It came from the red cedar trees that were all over the land. Their fun fact, alert. Did you know that when you cut open a red cedar tree, the cedar has a pale pink color inside? Yeah, I guess it's like super pretty, super beautiful. But did you also know that you cut me open? I've got a little pink inside and anyways, so they called the town Rosewood after the pink color. Be nice. Right? Well as we've learned through history, we can't have nice things. When people saw the really pretty color that was inside of these beautiful incredible trees. What do you think they did? They cut them down and they sold the lumber now because of this they made a pretty decent amount of money and it's supported the economy of the town but still, you know, God for the trees by the year 1886 the town had developed quite a bit. It had its own post office, a Schoolhouse and there were three churches one for the white people into for the black people. Remember, we're talking about a time. That's very A segregated America. So four years later in 1890 the town began to hit some hard times. All the red cedar trees have been chopped down and without the trees. There's no money to be made which in turn leads to the town's economic decline because of the loss of income and not many available jobs, many members of the white Community left, Rosewood, and headed to the nearby town of Sumner Sumner was appealing because there was a large Sawmill which provided tons of jobs and right now the people needed work, so, sign me up for something, you know, so by the year 1903, what population has now shifted to a majority black community? \", \"Now, it's a Rosewood. There was a really close sense of community. Like, everyone seemed to know one another and looked out for one another as well. I mean, rarely did anyone need to leave town like to travel for food or for things? They may need because they had almost everything right there. Andros, what in addition to the three churches Schoolhouse and post office, Rosewood also had a train station, which will become important later a general store and a Sugar Mill. Plus, if you were looking for some fun, they even had a Rosewood baseball team. What I'm getting at is Rosewood, was overall, just a nice place. So, for over 20 years, the people of Rosewood stayed with in Rosewood and the people of Sumner the neighboring town, they stayed with in Sumner, they coexisted. They had their own Communities going on and they were just doing their own thing. But unfortunately, at peaceful time was about to end cuz some shit was a bruin. But before we get into, what was a bruin, let's pause for a word from our sponsor. Things are kind of getting back to normal, I guess, right? Yeah, but I swear to you over quarantine, my brain is felt like mush. I need some exercise. I mean, it is a muscle, right, you know, any help with best fiends. It feels. My brain got a great work out. What's best fiends. You ask. Well, it's the mobile puzzle game that will put challenge to your Noggin, and it's kind of like you did a workout. \", \"But again, for your brain, not only that, best fiends is so funny, won't want to put it down.

Without the our best fiends. Thanks, best fiends are partnering with me. \", \"Today's episode January, 1st. 1923 are young, couple James and Fannie, Taylor, who are white are waking up on the first day of the new year. And James was like goodbye ciani. Like I'm off to work. I love you. Babe, you know and soon as I come and have a good day. Whatever. That's probably what they did. Anyways, so James leaves his wife and a home alone cuz he has to go to work. She works at The Sawmill in Sumner which was about 1 mi east of Rosewood. LOL. James at work. Milling, saws Fanny back at home. Rumor had it. Someone had attacked her. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, the neighbors heard screams. We heard screams coming from within the Taylor's house and they were like, oh my God, you know, like what's going on screaming? So for you and I, we probably go and, like check it out, right would be like, oh my God, you're screaming. Are you? Okay, but for Fanny's, Neighbors. I heard the screams and then they just left it alone. Great Tina. So sometime those by and James comes home from work and when he gets home, he sees that fanny has a big bruise on her face. It's clear that somebody had hit her pretty badly. So he asked her, you know, who did this to you and Fanny tells him that a black man assaulted her. She's like, I don't know who it was, but it was definitely a black man. According to Fanny. I mean, this could be possible. This guy came in randomly, beat her, I guess in her own house, but remember like this is a small town. In fact. Turner and Rosewood weren't so small, that most people recognize one another. So Are you sure be any? Are you sure? That's where you sell Fanny, Fanny? They could not name the person who attacked her. That should have been the first red flag. Okay. That maybe this person that attacked her was not a resident from Rosewood. I'm telling you, I'm not kidding you. If you lived in Rosewood, you would know your neighbors everybody knew each other. But Fanny would most likely know this person because again, the likelihood of her not knowing is pretty slim to not so sure. Kenny. Sure again, because it's, it's a 1920s. Unfortunately, this is a time when a white woman made bold claims being attacked by a black person. Nobody questioned it. They just believed it to be true. So they didn't question Fanny story for one second. Like, oh my God. She was beaten by a black man. Like we are so angry and nobody wanted to like double check and make sure where she what he wasn't lying. They just said, okay, and the story about Saint Nick, it's back to a woman by the name of Sarah carrier. She's like, wait a minute. Wait a minute.   That's not true. Singer said that she was at the Tailor's home, the morning of that so-called attack and not just that, but her granddaughter was there with neither of them. \", \"Saw black man attacks. Annie, let it alone. Even enter their house. You're probably wondering who he'll Sarah. Okay. She had been working for the Taylor's for quite some time. She was there that day with her granddaughter doing the Taylor's laundry. Now, Sarah said that she actually saw a white man leaving the Taylor house that morning. She said, she never saw a black man. Come by the house all day. Now get this, get this Sarah recognize this white man. She had seen him come by the house once or twice before. Sarah had to leave that this man and Fannie. We're having some kind of Winky dinky if you know what I mean. Sarah said that this man was actually the guy that beat Fannie that morning and that she was just lying to cover her ass because she's probably having an affair and she doesn't want people to know Danny to Sarah's version is now going around town. It's spreading like wildfire within the black community. They all 100% believed her. \", \"Why, why would she lie, why would you lie? Unfortunately, though the white voices were louder within the community and made it very clear that Fanny was quote, unquote, not a liar to tell the truth. I freaking roll-rite, it gets a lot more traumatic talking amongst the name comes up, Jesse Hunter, and they think they're discussing are like, Hey, Jessie Hunter, this is our guy. This is the guy who did it. Who is Jesse Hunter? Okay. Now Jesse Hunter was a black man who recently escaped from the nearby prison. Now because Jesse was a black man who recently escaped from prison while they're believing. He must have done. It must be the same black man that attacked Fanny know, my sarcasm mind you, there was absolutely one hundred percent. \", \"Zero evidence that Jesse was the perpetrator, but that doesn't matter to them. They've got their minds set on Jessie Hunter and they go out looking for him. Well, out, looking for him, the county, sheriff, Robert Walker, he joins in on the search. Now, this County Sheriff, was able to get a bunch of other white men together to form. What was called a posse to help with the search. Now, this isn't like your normal Posse today, like a group of friends hanging out back. Then a posse was a more formal thing. It was an official group of men that is Sheriff organized in case of an emergency. And this to them at the time will, this was that kind of Emergency. The sheriff would pull in some guys from around town. I don't know how he picked them, but he did and he made them his temporary deputies, which is wild to think just ran it. Like, hey, you your, your Deputy now is like You were allowed to do that. So the county sheriff got the Posse together and they start searching for Jesse. Now, they were determined to catch him and punish him for his alleged Attack Force panty. The possibly even went down to the local prison to borrow a pack of bloodhounds to track Jesse sent. I mean, they were seeing red. No common sense going on here. The Posse, they hear that. Jesse was last seen with another black man named Sam. Carter. Who worked as the local blacksmith. Now, this alleged sighting has never been confirmed, but they don't care. Now remember again. I said it a hundred times. It's a small town. \", \"So they know exactly where Sam Carter lives and they had straight to his house. They barged in, okay. And they interrogated Sam. And I was like, where's Jessie and Jessie? We need to know where he is right now. Where is he going? Where is Jesse? But Sam, he couldn't answer their questions because He didn't have the answers. You know, he doesn't know. He has no idea what's going on. Of course. The Posse doesn't believe him. They were convinced that Sam. He knew something because they are convinced of this, they get swept up and what the compass is angry mob mentality. So they force am out of the house. They kidnap him. The Posse stop process was that if they torture, Sam like, they can probably get some answers as to where Jesse is. So they kidnap Sam. They hung him from a tree by his neck. Pushing Sam to tell quote, on quote truth Sam. He was telling the truth all the time. He didn't know where Jesse was, but that's not acceptable to the Posse. They're hell-bent on their mission of quote-unquote Justice. They shot him to death and left his body in the road between Rosewood and Sumner Sam. Carter was only 45 years old. \", \"This is just the tip of the iceberg. So by that night, the original Posse, which was a small at first working mom. Oh, yeah. People were talking and the neighboring towns got word about like what had taken place and that this Manhunt for Jesse was going down. So a bunch of Randall, white men, come out of the, freaking would work is like to come from up. There was no official count of how many men joined this Riot, but that's exactly what it turns into a freaking Riot. And this is when the massacre begins, I know this is a little heavy.

Thank you. Hello, fresh for partnering with me on today's episode. The death of poor Sam. Carter was the Catalyst for what was about to become the Rosewood Massacre. The Posse is still out searching for Jesse Hunter. Remember, the prison escapee who the mama believe beat Fannie, but now, but now the policy searching for Jesse, it's, it's growing bigger and bigger. And more white men are joining this mob from all over Florida, because his mom had grown to, like such a big, a big site members of the community families, both black and white could sense that things were getting out of control. Violence was a brew in and this no longer feels like it was just a search for Jessie. It was turning more aggressive angry hate-filled, as this white mob was Now, using this as an excuse to destroy everything in sight. \", \"So the black community is terrified by what they're seeing happening in their own town of Rosewood. They thought that maybe if they got together in a large group and like some of their homes, they would be safety in large numbers, protecting them. We did that a couple of days go by and on day 3, there's another rumor spreading around that Jesse was actually hiding in one of the homes that they missed back in and the home was none. \", \"Other than Sarah carriers house. Remember, Sarah carrier from earlier. She's the one that who did the laundry for the tailors who told the truth? Who had the real story. Sarah, Sarah, son, Sylvester carrier. \", \"She also lived in the house with her. Now. There was some tension between Sylvester and the people of the white Community because he was known for speaking up for himself and protecting the women in his family, which I know what's wrong with that. There's absolutely nothing good for him. Good for him. I know. I agree with you. But again, this is the 1920s. It wasn't smart. When was Mark to stand up for yourself or others towards white person, unless you wanted some issues. So with all that being said, it's kind of not surprising when the Posse looked at Sylvester as their next Target now and angry mob coming their way Sylvester. And Sarah also had another problem. They were keeping a lot of children from the community within their home. Although, the exact number wasn't known. You see their home was Close to a swamp which in turn made a great location to hide because it provided cover and it wasn't easy to walk around in. Making it hard to be followed or even get caught. Unfortunately. The swamp would come to be their best protection on the fourth day of this Riot. January 4th. The white mob is headed for the carrier home. It's Sylvester wasn't going to just hide and do nothing. He was going to defend himself his family, the children his property and it was about to get violent when the mob gets to the carrier's house. The first thing they do. I'm sorry, but they shoot the carriers dog. I know, one of the guys in the mob, he calls out to Sylvester. He's like, hey, come out here and protect yourself and come face us. Some time goes by, and they're getting no response. So now they're frustrated. They're pissed off to the white men from the mob. They decide to walk up on. The porch and start taking down the front or these two men were Henry Andrews, and Polly Wilkerson, and it's Wilkerson who ends up kicking in the front door. So, inside of the home with Sylvester and Sarah amongst the children. There was a nine year old girl named Minnie Lee Mitchell Langley. She said that Sylvester saved her that day mini recalled when Sylvester put her in a safe spot under the stairway while they got ready to fight. He also said that he got behind her, at one point, put a gun on her shoulder pointing it at the front door and waited for poly Wilkerson to kick the door down and then Polly finally kick that door down. Sylvester started shooting to defend themselves. They would end up, killing both Andrews, and Wilkerson. Great, you know good. Can I see that? But listen, once the mob realize that Andrews in Wilkerson were shot and killed, they was not good. They were raging. Okay, they were to live and they were fuming and a gunfight then ensued. Sadly, there carrier and her son Sylvester in the middle of this. Crossfire. We're both tragically murdered the mod, keep shooting and deal, freaking care who they're hitting. The only reason they eventually stopped firing was because they ran out of full it great. Now we don't know how many men women and children hiding in the house with Sarah and Sylvester survived. Any what we do know is that the ones who were able to sneak out of the house, they went in the head in swamp, they escaped but not before they saw things that they wouldn't ever forget. One of the children are necklines spoke later about their struggle to escape. Gwen said, he remember some staying out for two or three long January nights. In the cold swamp, scared for their lives, but after days of waiting, you were able to escape them off now, the guys in the mob or pumped with adrenaline and anger and they are ready to cause more destruction. They decided to set fire across several houses, and a church on their way back home. \", 'So this was no longer about Fanny or Jesse. This was just a mission to destroy any property owned by the black community. In a Rosewood and the server. Areas with the mob, on the move, the black people living in Rosewood began to flee, the town in a hurry. They knew that the mob would be coming back. Wanting revenge for the murder of Andrews in Wilkerson. They work. I just let that go so many head in the cover of the swamp. Like the kids did thinking it would be hard to find them or catch them in there within Rosewood lived. A man named John right now. John Wright was well known within the black community. ', \"He was a white man, but he was friendly to his neighbors. Again. This is a different time. Right? And John, he wanted to help protect them in their time of need. He seemed out his window. It's going down in Rosewood, and he wants to open up his door and help the community. These are his neighbors, his friends, his family. You can't just sit back and watch it because Sean was white, the mob. Didn't even think about bringing down his house. No. No, they did not. They were like, nope. He's why he's good. Save his house, but burnt all these over here. \", \"They were also white families in Sumner who sheltered and protected, people who is a new often people who works for them Friday morning on January 5th, 1923. It's now, five of the Rosewood Massacre things have been pretty bad so far, but It's about to get even more real 200 armed. White men come storming into Rosewood and they're coming from all over the state to be a part of this action with those two hundred armed white, men summer. \", \"Even members of the Klu Klux Klan. As you can, probably imagine. This is not good. This is very bad wire. They even hear. How did they like? Why are they here? What are they doing here? There isn't even much information as to how these guys knew what was going on. But what we do know is that they showed up, so the group is gotten a lot larger, right? And they were causing way more damage and destruction. They burned more homes. They burn the second Church, the Masonic Lodge, just everything, complete and utter destruction. Everything is gone, except John Wright's house. But this point, it's hard to know how many black residents are still left in their town. \", \"Those who could they ran for the swamp? But unfortunately, those who were too old or sick to run. They were trapped there, and the members of the mob shot them on site, such as Lexi Gordon. She was a Rosewood resident. She ran from her burning home. Day. Trying to escape when she was shot in the back and killed not just killed. She was murdered the same day. A man named, Minka Williams was also murdered. He was shot in the head. He wasn't even from Rosewood. He was literally just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Mingo was the seventh recorded person to die in Rosewood so far. There's Sam. Carter Sylvester carrier his mother Sarah Lexi Gordon. And now Mingo Williams who are killed by the mob, murdered by the mob. And then there's Henry Andrews and Polly Wilkerson who were killed while storming, the carrier house. So in the early hours of day, 6, Around 4 a.m. Some help. Finally comes for those who are trying to escape this destruction. \", \"By this time, word got out about what was going on in roast. What? And everybody was talking about the Wright, brothers, John and William, Brice. Also got word about what was taking place in Rosewood. I know, I know, I know, I don't know. What's a lot of names and throwing at you, but who are John and William Bryce? \", \"Okay. Well, then they work as train conductors, who happen to pass through the Rosewood train station all of the time and the Rosewood train station, was one of the only things that wasn't burned down. So when they found out what was happening, taking place, what was going down in Rosewood, they knew that they had to help out their community. So the brothers pulled her train into the station, to allow women, and children, who had been hiding in the swamp, hop on the train and get the heck out of Rosewood as fast as they could with a train full of people to brace Brothers stopped in different cities along. The route allowing the survivors to get off the train and attempt to begin their lives. \", \"Again and a new city. They had left everything behind the Xscape near death, and now, they were forced to live in fear and never return to their homes. In Rosewood, again, to this day, some of the victims descendants still live in the nearby towns that they went to my Gainesville Florida.

Thank you to Squarespace. Hey Square, Face on Sunday, January 6th, 1923. This is the Sixth and final day of the Rosewood Massacre. The angry Posse turned mom that it burned most of Rosewood and left a path of destruction. In its wake was, Now, setting out to finish what they started. They wanted to burn down any property left and kill any black residents would not escaped. So they come across James carrier on the road. James was Sarah's brother and sold uncle. And he was partially paralyzed from a stroke while Sarah and Sylvester had brayley held down the fort during the attack. He had escaped. The children also hitting with them in the swamp after it seems like, you know, the danger might have passed, so he gets up and he leaves the swamp hoping to return to his home and just kind of figure it out from there. Right? But unfortunately James, he want to make it some members of the mob. They surrounded him. They marched him to the local Cemetery where they then shot and murder. Right next to the fresh Graves of Sarah and Sylvester. I know, I know. I know after the murder of James, the mob, just kept setting fire to all the homes and buildings until literally, there's nothing left. Rosewood was completely wiped. It was destroyed. It was gone with that being said, what we know for sure is that at least eight people died during the Rosewood Massacre, but would hasn't been recorded trauma on the community, for decades to come and I should. It's believed that there are a lot more victims and just ate, but there are eight, like, on record. So, a few weeks go by, and in February of 1923 somebody. Somebody finally speaks up and they're like, hey, Something just happened over here, that maybe we should talk about, so they bring it to the attention of a grand jury the way. A grand jury worked at least back. Then, was that a prosecutor represent the case to a group of citizens, and they can ask questions and investigate the situation and they get to decide if they think anyone should be charged with a crime. It sounds pretty fair, right? Thing. It's the thought of it, the idea of it sounds pretty fair in 1923 and fortunately, this jury would have been all white. So, I was surprised when they didn't see anything wrong with what had taken place in Rosewood and they chose not to press any charges. No one involved in the massacre was found guilty of a crime. In fact, to make things even worse. No one was even arrested for these murders. It took until the 1931 case of the Scottsboro boys for any kind of solid law. \", \"Push back to Stop black people from being excluded, from being chairs. This case, which involved to 9 black teenagers, accused of allegedly raping a white woman had not just one trial, but is series all kinds of reversals, dismissals retrials. I mean, it lasted over two decades. This whole thing is a wild story Denver, definitely going to have to do it for another time. But after it was discovered that there were no black people in the jury records. There were names that have been forged to make it look like there was AKA they like they forged them saying you get it once. They realize that the names had been forged did the Supreme Court say the Alabama jury selection process was unconstitutional because it was all white and it's cleared black people on purpose. This of course, didn't get rid of the all-white juries, but it was a start and that's important because in Florida, I'll wager. He's were 16% more likely to convicted black defendants, then white dependents and that's not looking good when you were looking for a fair trial, Fair trial, like, come on, you guys know, besides all of that the cherry on top of this, whole story, all the records relating to the Rosewood Massacre or loss gone. \", \"Poof scared. No records. What happened? There's no records as to what took place in Rosewood. The only way we're able to tell this story of history is By Word of Mouth. Now, we're going to pause for a break this summer is showing welcoming signs of a more normal life ahead. Finally. You can get back to enjoying the little things in life are smiling at your neighbor. Hey, Bob, you know, seeing a movie? Maybe even going to the post office. I guess what? I live, a boring normal life. I didn't choose this life. \", \"It shows me, but was Samsung come. You can actually skip trips to the post office and even save money on postage. Save money. You say yes who, like saving money, you do male and / or ship anytime anywhere.

A big thank you to stamps.com for partnering with me on today's episode for the survivors of the Rosewood Massacre, the fear from that date, it lingered. Okay, as I said before many relocated to other towns in Florida and none of them would end up returning to live in Rosewood. \", \"Some of the victims even went as far as changing their names when they move, because they were afraid that the people in the mob, they weren't going to stop looking for them. They're going to continue to hunt them down until they kill them. So the survivors, the people of Rosewood, they're living in constant fear, you know, they're always watching her back thinking, these guys are going to come for them. \", \"And I think we can both agree. That's the way to live our net. Doctor. Sarah carriers, free grandson said that within the family home. There was like a strict set of rules that nobody brought up the massacre. Nobody talks about it, unless the elders. On top of that, many of those who participated in the mob were still alive and Arnett. He recalled that his mother. She knew some of them fine. It was just psychological trauma and fear. That would be passed on throughout these families for generations to come the stories from that day. Lived on within the black community, not forgiving, and definitely not forgotten. There's a saying that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. So, while this story was not widely broadcasted, there are those who made it a mission, to make sure that this massacre did not slip away or be forgotten in the sands of time. Even without that, the fear, and the trauma from this. What effects of survivors lives forever, aside from the emotional scars, the pain, the morning, the fear. \", \"There was a huge loss of property and wealth, which, okay. I know what you're thinking like property. Wealth is nothing in comparison to losing loved ones, but it was what they had to pass down to their children, or to their families. And because the people in Rosewood millionaires, you know, they owned their own businesses houses and their own land. That's what they had. That's what they hatch their names. All of, that was taken from them. And burnt to the ground. They weren't robbed the land or structures. They were robbed of leaving their legacies and their chance to leave what they built for their children. \", \"So, And you're not miss hearing me with this next sentence, 71 years ago by yes, 71 years go by. Finally, the Rosewood Massacre would properly I'm saying that sarcastically be acknowledged. So the survivors, they received some money if they could prove that they were direct descendants of Rosewood Property Owners. These checks are little more than insult to injury and some were as little, as $100 or less, which is like avocado. Thanks. This was actually the first bill in the United States. Compensated, the black community for a past racial Injustice, 2 Black and Hispanic caucuses or groups of lawmakers. They, pushed hard to get this recognition in 2020. Yeah. You heard me right 2020 babe, the State of Florida, for the scholarship for the direct descendants. It would only pay for some of the students to attend college, but Florida also put together a formal commission, which would be dedicated to researching the history of this tragedy. I'd only that it would allow the descendants to share their stories in their own words and their voices would finally be heard. So you're probably wondering what happened to Fanny. There's no record that Fanny ever came clean about the lie that she spread any never told the truth. \", \"You got something to say, let us know what remains of Rosewood today. Maybe like there's a big Monument, you know, where you can show your respects to you or something, you know, well for small town that once had about like a take 300 people living in it. Most people have since left and gone to different communities in the surrounding area. And again, when we said they never came back, they never came back. There's only one house left standing in Rosewood and guess whose house that is. John Wright's house. Remember, he was the man who opened his door to the community, as a safe house. His house is still there. I'm getting I'm laughing because and that's it. You know how you would think this, would be some kind of historical monument and Rosewood. Right? Right. You would think that right in the house. It was actually up for sale and it was sold to some random ass family in 2020, which is totally fine. Thank you. Yeah, but I brought you surprised that this this house is in a monument or anyting down. Like they be protected by the state because it's all that's left of Rosewood. You think, right? It's what's left of the Rosewood Massacre. You think it would be considered historical monument, right? Okay, great. We're on the same page. I'm glad you agree with the Rosewood Heritage Foundation. They've tried to reach out to the family who moved in to John Wright's home, but they haven't heard any response. The future of historical home. It remains. Unclear, This moment in history is just awful, right? Unfortunately, though it's kind of familiar. It sounds a lot. Like the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Tulsa Race Massacre took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921, and it also started as a reaction. To a young black boy who was accused of hurting the a white woman and all these murders and writers destroyed Tulsa. Again, it if you've never heard about the Tulsa Race Massacre, I would highly recommend that. After this, you should take a moment and educate yourself on what happened. I did a full video on it over my YouTube. If you want to check that out, but I would highly suggest you do research and educate yourself on at 2, but stories, like today, it just showcases Decades of violence with a fax that still persist today. \", \"We need to make sure that we are keeping history honest and transparent because without that weird To repeat it and look, it was until freaking 2020 that they started this Foundation to help The Descendants and like yes, that's amazing. That's incredible. And they've been working so hard to get egg knowledge mint for it. But the same time you're like what took them so long, you know, I think that's I think that's a great question. People like, dr. Edward Gonzalez. Tenant make sure that the story is kept alive, passed on for generations to come and the communities voices are indeed heard. He started the Rosewood Heritage and see our project or virtual. Rosewood, If you're curious to learn more, the link will be in the show. Christ, scripture box with this project is as dedicated to the Rosewood victims and making sure that their story is never forgotten since our history books seem to have left that section. Ouch, you know, these foundations keep the conversation on going by building a movement to build memoriams and landmarks even working towards trying to make Rosewood. National Historic Landmark, there has been talks about building museums and Exhibits in Florida. I mean, as they should. But for now, there's a sign and Rosewood sponsored by the real Rosewood Foundation that does share the horrific events that took place in Rosewood in 1923. And that my friends is the horrible dark history of the Rosewood Massacre heavy, huh? Stories, like this can be really uncomfortable. You know, how can we ever learn and grow? If we don't know where he's been. And the Rosewood Massacre is a fraction of what's been taking place in our country for a very long time. In the story, notes going to put some further reading. If you want to learn more and become more educated with the Rosewood Massacre. I will love to hear from you guys. So if we have Twitter, let's skedaddle over there. And let's continue this conversation. Use the hashtag dark here. I would love to hear your thoughts. If you learn from the story, you can also join me over on my YouTube or you can watch these episodes after the podcast airs, and also catch murder mystery makeup with straps every Monday. Appreciate you guys. I love you guys. I hope you have a great rest of your day ahead. Please make good choices. Okay, and I'll be talking to you next week. Dark history is an audio.

We heard screams coming within Taylor 's house like , oh God , know , like 's going screaming ? So I , probably go , like check , right would like , oh God , 're screaming . Are ? Okay , Fanny 's , Neighbors . I heard screams left alone . Great Tina . So sometime James comes home work gets home , sees fanny big bruise face . It 's clear somebody hit pretty badly . So asked , know , Fanny tells black man assaulted . She 's like , I n't know , definitely black man . According Fanny . I mean , could possible . This guy came randomly , beat , I guess house , remember like small town . In fact . Turner Rosewood n't small , people recognize one another . So Are sure ? Are sure ? That 's sell Fanny , Fanny ? They could name person attacked . That first red flag . Okay . That maybe person attacked resident Rosewood . I 'm telling , I 'm kidding . If lived Rosewood , would know neighbors everybody knew . But Fanny would likely know person , likelihood knowing pretty slim sure . Kenny . Sure , 's , 's 1920s . Unfortunately , time white woman made bold claims attacked black person . Nobody questioned . They believed true . So n't question Fanny story one second . Like , oh God . She beaten black man . Like angry nobody wanted like double check make sure n't lying . They said , okay , story Saint Nick , 's back woman name Sarah carrier . She 's like , wait minute . Wait minute . That 's true .

Well , , looking , county , sheriff , Robert Walker , joins search . Now , County Sheriff , able get bunch white men together form . What called posse help search . Now , n't like normal Posse today , like group friends hanging back . Then posse formal thing . It official group men Sheriff organized case emergency . And time , kind Emergency .

So county sheriff got Posse together start searching Jesse . Now , determined catch punish alleged Attack Force panty . The possibly even went local prison borrow pack bloodhounds track Jesse sent . I mean , seeing red . No common sense going . The Posse , hear . Jesse last seen another black man named Sam . Carter . Who worked local blacksmith .

            "White families had moved here prior to the Civil War and black landowner started to move in in the 1870s. \n",

            "Their fun fact, alert. \n",
            "Did you know that when you cut open a red cedar tree, the cedar has a pale pink color inside? \n",
            "Yeah, I guess it's like super pretty, super beautiful. \n",
            "But did you also know that you cut me open? \n",
            "I've got a little pink inside and anyways, so they called the town Rosewood after the pink color. \n",
            "Be nice. \n",
            "Right? \n",
            "Well as we've learned through history, we can't have nice things. \n",
            "When people saw the really pretty color that was inside of these beautiful incredible trees. \n",
            "What do you think they did? \n",
            "They cut them down and they sold the lumber now because of this they made a pretty decent amount of money and it's supported the economy of the town but still, you know, God for the trees by the year 1886 the town had developed quite a bit. \n",
            "It had its own post office, a Schoolhouse and there were three churches one for the white people into for the black people. \n",
            "Remember, we're talking about a time. \n",
            "That's very A segregated America. \n",
            "So four years later in 1890 the town began to hit some hard times. \n",
            "All the red cedar trees have been chopped down and without the trees. \n",
            "There's no money to be made which in turn leads to the town's economic decline because of the loss of income and not many available jobs, many members of the white Community left, Rosewood, and headed to the nearby town of Sumner Sumner was appealing because there was a large Sawmill which provided tons of jobs and right now the people needed work, so, sign me up for something, you know, so by the year 1903, what population has now shifted to a majority black community? \n",
            "Now, it's a Rosewood. \n",
            "There was a really close sense of community. \n",
            "Like, everyone seemed to know one another and looked out for one another as well. \n",
            "I mean, rarely did anyone need to leave town like to travel for food or for things? \n",
            "They may need because they had almost everything right there. \n",
            "Andros, what in addition to the three churches Schoolhouse and post office, Rosewood also had a train station, which will become important later a general store and a Sugar Mill. \n",
            "Plus, if you were looking for some fun, they even had a Rosewood baseball team. \n",
            "What I'm getting at is Rosewood, was overall, just a nice place. \n",
            "So, for over 20 years, the people of Rosewood stayed with in Rosewood and the people of Sumner the neighboring town, they stayed with in Sumner, they coexisted. \n",
            "They had their own Communities going on and they were just doing their own thing. \n",
            "But unfortunately, at peaceful time was about to end cuz some shit was a bruin. \n",
            "James at work. \n",
            "Milling, saws Fanny back at home. \n",
            "Rumor had it. \n",
            "Someone had attacked her. \n",
            "Oh, yeah. \n",
            "Oh, yeah, the neighbors heard screams. \n",
            "We heard screams coming from within the Taylor's house and they were like, oh my God, you know, like what's going on screaming? \n",
            "So for you and I, we probably go and, like check it out, right would be like, oh my God, you're screaming. \n",
            "Are you? \n",
            "Okay, but for Fanny's, Neighbors. \n",
            "I heard the screams and then they just left it alone. \n",
            "Great Tina. \n",
            "So sometime those by and James comes home from work and when he gets home, he sees that fanny has a big bruise on her face. \n",
            "It's clear that somebody had hit her pretty badly. \n",
            "So he asked her, you know, who did this to you and Fanny tells him that a black man assaulted her. \n",
            "She's like, I don't know who it was, but it was definitely a black man. \n",
            "According to Fanny. \n",
            "I mean, this could be possible. \n",
            "This guy came in randomly, beat her, I guess in her own house, but remember like this is a small town. \n",
            "In fact. \n",
            "Turner and Rosewood weren't so small, that most people recognize one another. \n",
            "So Are you sure be any? \n",
            "Are you sure? \n",
            "That's where you sell Fanny, Fanny? \n",
            "They could not name the person who attacked her. \n",
            "That should have been the first red flag. \n",
            "Okay. \n",
            "That maybe this person that attacked her was not a resident from Rosewood. \n",
            "I'm telling you, I'm not kidding you. \n",
            "If you lived in Rosewood, you would know your neighbors everybody knew each other. \n",
            "But Fanny would most likely know this person because again, the likelihood of her not knowing is pretty slim to not so sure. \n",
            "Kenny. \n",
            "Sure again, because it's, it's a 1920s. \n",
            "Unfortunately, this is a time when a white woman made bold claims being attacked by a black person. \n",
            "Nobody questioned it. \n",
            "They just believed it to be true. \n",
            "So they didn't question Fanny story for one second. \n",
            "Like, oh my God. \n",
            "She was beaten by a black man. \n",
            "Like we are so angry and nobody wanted to like double check and make sure where she what he wasn't lying. \n",
            "They just said, okay, and the story about Saint Nick, it's back to a woman by the name of Sarah carrier. \n",
            "She's like, wait a minute. \n",
            "Wait a minute. \n",
            " \n",
            " \n",
            "That's not true. \n",
            "Singer said that she was at the Tailor's home, the morning of that so-called attack and not just that, but her granddaughter was there with neither of them. \n",
            "Saw black man attacks. \n",
            "Annie, let it alone. \n",
            "Even enter their house. \n",
            "You're probably wondering who he'll Sarah. \n",
            "Okay. \n",
            "She had been working for the Taylor's for quite some time. \n",
            "She was there that day with her granddaughter doing the Taylor's laundry. \n",
            "Now, Sarah said that she actually saw a white man leaving the Taylor house that morning. \n",
            "She said, she never saw a black man. \n",
            "Come by the house all day. \n",
            "Now get this, get this Sarah recognize this white man. \n",
            "She had seen him come by the house once or twice before. \n",
            "Sarah had to leave that this man and Fannie. \n",
            "We're having some kind of Winky dinky if you know what I mean. \n",
            "Sarah said that this man was actually the guy that beat Fannie that morning and that she was just lying to cover her ass because she's probably having an affair and she doesn't want people to know Danny to Sarah's version is now going around town. \n",
            "It's spreading like wildfire within the black community. \n",
            "They all 100% believed her. \n",
            "Why, why would she lie, why would you lie? \n",
            "Unfortunately, though the white voices were louder within the community and made it very clear that Fanny was quote, unquote, not a liar to tell the truth. \n",
            "I freaking roll-rite, it gets a lot more traumatic talking amongst the name comes up, Jesse Hunter, and they think they're discussing are like, Hey, Jessie Hunter, this is our guy. \n",
            "This is the guy who did it. \n",
            "Who is Jesse Hunter? \n",
            "Okay. \n",
            "Now Jesse Hunter was a black man who recently escaped from the nearby prison. \n",
            "Now because Jesse was a black man who recently escaped from prison while they're believing. \n",
            "He must have done. \n",
            "It must be the same black man that attacked Fanny know, my sarcasm mind you, there was absolutely one hundred percent. \n",
            "Zero evidence that Jesse was the perpetrator, but that doesn't matter to them. \n",
            "They've got their minds set on Jessie Hunter and they go out looking for him. \n",
            "Well, out, looking for him, the county, sheriff, Robert Walker, he joins in on the search. \n",
            "Now, this County Sheriff, was able to get a bunch of other white men together to form. \n",
            "What was called a posse to help with the search. \n",
            "Now, this isn't like your normal Posse today, like a group of friends hanging out back. \n",

            "It was an official group of men that is Sheriff organized in case of an emergency. \n",
            "And this to them at the time will, this was that kind of Emergency. \n",
            "The sheriff would pull in some guys from around town. \n",
            "I don't know how he picked them, but he did and he made them his temporary deputies, which is wild to think just ran it. \n",
            "Like, hey, you your, your Deputy now is like You were allowed to do that. \n",
            "So the county sheriff got the Posse together and they start searching for Jesse. \n",

            "It would only pay for some of the students to attend college, but Florida also put together a formal commission, which would be dedicated to researching the history of this tragedy. \n",
            "I'd only that it would allow the descendants to share their stories in their own words and their voices would finally be heard. \n",
            "So you're probably wondering what happened to Fanny. \n",
            "There's no record that Fanny ever came clean about the lie that she spread any never told the truth. \n",
            "You got something to say, let us know what remains of Rosewood today. \n",
            "Maybe like there's a big Monument, you know, where you can show your respects to you or something, you know, well for small town that once had about like a take 300 people living in it. \n",
            "Most people have since left and gone to different communities in the surrounding area. \n",

            "Right? \n",
            "Right. \n",
            "You would think that right in the house. \n",
            "It was actually up for sale and it was sold to some random ass family in 2020, which is totally fine. \n",
            "Thank you. \n",
            "Yeah, but I brought you surprised that this this house is in a monument or anyting down. \n",
            "Like they be protected by the state because it's all that's left of Rosewood. \n",
            "You think, right? \n",
            "It's what's left of the Rosewood Massacre. \n",
            "You think it would be considered historical monument, right? \n",
            "Okay, great. \n",
            "We're on the same page. \n",
            "I'm glad you agree with the Rosewood Heritage Foundation. \n",
            "They've tried to reach out to the family who moved in to John Wright's home, but they haven't heard any response. \n",
            "The future of historical home. \n",
            "It remains. \n",
            "Unclear, This moment in history is just awful, right? \n",
            "Unfortunately, though it's kind of familiar. \n",
            "It sounds a lot. \n",
            "Like the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Tulsa Race Massacre took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921, and it also started as a reaction. \n",
            "To a young black boy who was accused of hurting the a white woman and all these murders and writers destroyed Tulsa. \n",
            "Again, it if you've never heard about the Tulsa Race Massacre, I would highly recommend that. \n",
            "After this, you should take a moment and educate yourself on what happened. \n",
            "I did a full video on it over my YouTube. \n",
            "If you want to check that out, but I would highly suggest you do research and educate yourself on at 2, but stories, like today, it just showcases Decades of violence with a fax that still persist today. \n",
            "We need to make sure that we are keeping history honest and transparent because without that weird To repeat it and look, it was until freaking 2020 that they started this Foundation to help The Descendants and like yes, that's amazing. \n",
            "That's incredible. \n",
            "And they've been working so hard to get egg knowledge mint for it. \n",
            "But the same time you're like what took them so long, you know, I think that's I think that's a great question. \n",

            "Christ, scripture box with this project is as dedicated to the Rosewood victims and making sure that their story is never forgotten since our history books seem to have left that section. \n",
            "Ouch, you know, these foundations keep the conversation on going by building a movement to build memoriams and landmarks even working towards trying to make Rosewood. \n",
            "National Historic Landmark, there has been talks about building museums and Exhibits in Florida. \n",
            "I mean, as they should. \n",
